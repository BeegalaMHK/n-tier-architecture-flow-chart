<!-- With the Help of ChatGPT and Canva AI -->

I was learning about N-Tier Architecture, so I started asking GPT about it.

After reviewing the content I received, I decided to create a flowchart to better visualize the concept.

Next, I asked Canva AI to generate a flowchart. To my surprise, it provided me with HTML code for the flowchart.

Then, I requested GPT to convert that HTML code into a React application using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Now, you can see the final output live on the website.
